## Choosing NumPy: the Benefits

[NumPy](https://numpy.org/) is the most widely used package for scientific computing in Python. It 
provides a multidimensional array object and different derived objects (such as masked arrays and 
matrices), as well as a wide variety of ways to manipulate arrays. These include mathematical, 
logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear 
algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation, and much more. NumPy arrays facilitate 
advanced mathematical and other types of operations on large datasets.

Here are the top benefits of using NumPy:

- NumPy helps you reduce the loops and make your code clearer and easier to read.
- NumPy uses algorithms written in C that complete in nanoseconds rather than seconds: all explicit 
  looping, indexing, etc. is taking place "behind the scenes" in optimized, pre-compiled C code.
- Operations on large datasets are executed more efficiently and with less code than is 
  possible with Python’s built-in sequences. Fewer lines of code generally mean fewer bugs.
- A vast community is constantly working to keep NumPy fast, user-friendly, and bug-free.

Numerous scientific and mathematical Python-based packages use NumPy arrays. This means that in 
order to work efficiently with most of today’s scientific/mathematical Python-based software, just 
knowing how to use Python’s built-in sequence types is already insufficient – one also needs to be familiar 
with NumPy arrays.

NumPy fully supports an object-oriented approach, starting with ndarray, the object at the core of 
the NumPy package. Ndarray is a class possessing numerous methods and attributes. Many of its 
methods are mirrored by functions in the outermost NumPy namespace, allowing the 
programmer to code in whichever paradigm they prefer. This flexibility has allowed the 
NumPy array dialect and NumPy ndarray class to become the de-facto language of 
multi-dimensional data interchange used in Python.
