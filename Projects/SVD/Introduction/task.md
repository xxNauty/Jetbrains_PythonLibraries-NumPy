## Introduction

#### Who is this tutorial for?
This tutorial is for people who have a basic understanding of linear algebra and arrays in NumPy and 
want to find out how n-dimensional (n >= 2) arrays are represented and manipulated. In particular, 
if you are curious how to apply common functions to n-dimensional arrays (without using for-loops) 
or if you want to understand axis and shape properties for n-dimensional arrays, this tutorial might be of help.

#### Learning Objectives
After completing this tutorial, you should be able to:

- understand the difference between one-, two-, and n-dimensional arrays in NumPy;

- apply some linear algebra operations to n-dimensional arrays without using for-loops;

- understand axis and shape properties for n-dimensional arrays.

#### Content
Image compression is a very useful thing because it allows saving images without taking up large amounts of memory (data approximation).
In this lesson, we will use a [matrix decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_decomposition) from linear algebra,
the singular value decomposition, to generate a compressed approximation of an image while still retaining many of the original features. 

The lesson is based on the NumPy tutorial ["Linear algebra on n-dimensional arrays"](https://numpy.org/numpy-tutorials/content/tutorial-svd.html).
